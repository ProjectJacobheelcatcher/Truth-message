  <h1>The Truth Warning Message</h1>  <!-- PART 1–4 are inserted and unchanged -->  <h2>Part 5: Locusts, Birth by the Spirit, and the Final Warning</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Locust Army and the Pit</h2>
    <p>In Revelation 9, a terrifying image appears: a bottomless pit opens, and locusts come forth with power to torment. These may symbolize transformed, fallen souls turned into agents of judgment.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Revelation 9:1–3</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Rev.9" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth... and unto them was given power.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>You Must Be Born Again</h2>
    <p>Jesus told Nicodemus: unless you are born again of water and of the Spirit, you cannot see or enter the Kingdom of God. Flesh birth is not enough.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>John 3:3–5</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/John.3" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

    <h2>The Lake of Fire and the Second Death</h2>
    <p>There is a final destination for those who refuse truth and righteousness. Death and hell are cast into the lake of fire — this is the second death.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Revelation 20:14–15</strong><br>
      And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Choose This Day Whom You Will Serve</h2>
    <p>God sets before us life and death, blessing and cursing — choose life. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Joshua 24:15</strong><br>
      Choose you this day whom ye will serve.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>John 14:6</strong><br>
      I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Final Call to Action</h2>
    <p>This message is a wake-up call to seek Jesus while He may be found. Read the scriptures. Cry out to the Father. Ask for truth. Share this page.</p>
