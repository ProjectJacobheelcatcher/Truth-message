  <h1>The Truth Warning Message</h1>  <!-- Part 1–3 content remains unchanged above -->  <h2>Part 4: You Are Gods, Light, the Cherub, and the Star</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ye Are Gods – Elohim</h2>
    <p>Jesus quoted Psalm 82 saying we are gods (Elohim), children of the Most High. Yet we die like men. We are spiritual beings in flesh bodies.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Psalm 82:6</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Ps.82" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Jesus Quoting Psalm 82</h2>
    <p>Jesus defended Himself from accusations of blasphemy by referencing the law: “I said, Ye are gods.” The scripture cannot be broken.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>John 10:30–35</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/John.10" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Covering Cherub – Lucifer</h2>
    <p>Lucifer was the anointed cherub that covereth. After iniquity was found in him, he fell. He covered us with flesh. This is key to understanding the battle.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Ezekiel 28:14–15</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Ezek.28" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God... till iniquity was found in thee.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reprove Darkness – Let the Light In</h2>
    <p>We are asleep — spiritually dead — until the light of Christ reproves and awakens us. The light makes all things manifest.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Ephesians 5:11–14</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Eph.5" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Star and the Sign</h2>
    <p>The Bible links Jesus and prophecy with the star. There’s also the star from Jacob in Numbers. One eye to the Star — one eye to the Pit?</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 2:2</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.2" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      We have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Numbers 24:17</strong><br>
      There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel...
