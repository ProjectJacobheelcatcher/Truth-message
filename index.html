  <h1>The Truth Warning Message</h1>  <h2>Part 1: Foundations of the Warning</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth. God is our designated teacher. Pray for and desire Truth (Jesus is the Truth). Ask, Seek, Knock. Daniel 2 says that God is the revealer of secrets.</p>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Devil Runs the Kingdoms of Earth</h2>
    <p>The tenants of earth killed God's son and the prophets. They are a rebellious house and judgment is coming.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 4:8-9</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.4" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      The devil sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world... "All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Devil is a Liar</h2>
    <p>A crime syndicate led by the fallen angel Lucifer runs the kingdoms of earth. Jesus exposes him plainly.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>John 8:43-45</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/John.8" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Ye are of your father the devil... he is a liar, and the father of it.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Wheat and the Tares</h2>
    <p>Two kinds of people exist. The tares were sown among the wheat. We look alike but differ in spirit. You will know them by their fruit.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 13:24-30</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.13" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Let both grow together until the harvest...
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Two Great Powers</h2>
    <p>Earth is between the Lord God above and the Devil below. We must put on the armor of God to stand.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Ephesians 6:10-12</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Eph.6" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against rulers of the darkness of this world.
    </div>
  </div>  <h2>Part 2: Genesis, Elohim, and Creation</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Genesis 1 – Who Created?</h2>
    <p>In Genesis 1, God is not YHWH (the Lord God) but "Elohim" (H430) — plural gods or angels with delegated power. The Lord God only appears in Genesis 2.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Genesis 1:1</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Gen.1" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      In the beginning God (Elohim) created the heaven and the earth.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Genesis 1:27</strong><br>
      So God (Elohim) created man in his own image... male and female.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Genesis 2 – The Real Creator Appears</h2>
    <p>In Genesis 2, the LORD God (YHWH) forms Adam. He breathes a soul into man. This is the true beginning of God's personal work.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Genesis 2:2</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Gen.2" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      And on the seventh day God (Elohim) ended his work and rested.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Genesis 2:7</strong><br>
      The LORD God formed man of the dust... and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>El H410 – The Name of Almighty God</h2>
    <p>Hebrew 'El' (H410) refers to Almighty God. Many biblical names reflect this — such as Emmanuel (God with us).</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Isaiah 7:14</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Isa.7" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      A virgin shall conceive... and call his name Immanuel.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 1:23</strong><br>
      They shall call his name Emmanuel, which means, God with us.
    </div>
  </div>  <h2>Part 3: Inversion, The Eye, and Twin Spirits</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Inversion: The World Turned Upside Down</h2>
    <p>The truth is hidden by inversion and lies. To truly see, you must flip the world upside down spiritually.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Isaiah 29:15-16</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Isa.29" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Woe unto them that hide their counsel from the LORD... Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Liars: Calling Evil Good</h2>
    <p>The rulers who reject Christ invert good and evil. Their wisdom is prideful and deceitful.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Isaiah 5:20-21</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Isa.5" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil... Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Eye: Light or Darkness</h2>
    <p>Your eye is the lamp of your body. A single eye brings light. A double mind brings darkness.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 6:22-24</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.6" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light... Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Covert Signals: Winking & Deception</h2>
    <p>The enemy uses gestures and covert signals to signal deception and hatred without a cause.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Psalm 35:19-20</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Ps.35" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Let not them that are my enemies wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Proverbs 6:13</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Prov.6" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      He winketh with his eyes... teacheth with his fingers.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Twin Spirits & Internal War</h2>
    <p>We are born into a system of duality — good vs evil — within ourselves. Only Christ can make us whole.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>2 Timothy 2:25-26</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/2Tim.2" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves... that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Double Mindedness</h2>
    <p>Purify your heart. Draw near to God. Let Him make you single in purpose and Spirit.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>James 4:7-8</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Jas.4" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you... Purify your hearts, ye double minded.
    </div>
  </div>  <h2>Part 4: You Are Gods, Light, the Cherub, and the Star</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ye Are Gods – Elohim</h2>
    <p>Jesus quoted Psalm 82 saying we are gods (Elohim), children of the Most High. Yet we die like men. We are spiritual beings in flesh bodies.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Psalm 82:6</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Ps.82" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Jesus Quoting Psalm 82</h2>
    <p>Jesus defended Himself from accusations of blasphemy by referencing the law: “I said, Ye are gods.” The scripture cannot be broken.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>John 10:30–35</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/John.10" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Covering Cherub – Lucifer</h2>
    <p>Lucifer was the anointed cherub that covereth. After iniquity was found in him, he fell. He covered us with flesh. This is key to understanding the battle.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Ezekiel 28:14–15</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Ezek.28" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God... till iniquity was found in thee.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reprove Darkness – Let the Light In</h2>
    <p>We are asleep — spiritually dead — until the light of Christ reproves and awakens us. The light makes all things manifest.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Ephesians 5:11–14</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Eph.5" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Star and the Sign</h2>
    <p>The Bible links Jesus and prophecy with the star. There’s also the star from Jacob in Numbers. One eye to the Star — one eye to the Pit?</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 2:2</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.2" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      We have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
    </div>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Numbers 24:17</strong><br>
      There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel...
    </div>
