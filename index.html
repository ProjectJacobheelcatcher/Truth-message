  <h1>The Truth Warning Message</h1>

  <!-- Part 1 -->
  <h2>Part 1: Fundamentals and Scripture</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>The world is inverted. The devil lies and rules the earth’s systems. Christ alone is truth. Ask, seek, knock — and truth will be revealed.</p>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Matthew 4:8–9</strong><br />The devil offers Jesus all kingdoms of the world in exchange for worship.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>John 8:43–45</strong><br />Ye are of your father the devil... he is a liar, and the father of it.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Matthew 13:24–30</strong><br />The wheat and tares grow together until harvest. Two spiritual races.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Ephesians 6:10–12</strong><br />We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- Part 2 -->
  <h2>Part 2: Genesis and Elohim</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>Genesis 1 uses "Elohim" (plural). Genesis 2 introduces the Lord God (YHWH). This shows delegated authority, not direct creation by God Almighty.</p>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Genesis 1:1 & 1:27</strong><br />Elohim created the world and man in their image.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Genesis 2:2 & 2:7</strong><br />The LORD God formed man and breathed life into him.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Isaiah 7:14 & Matthew 1:23</strong><br />A virgin shall bear a son called Immanuel — God with us.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- Part 3 -->
  <h2>Part 3: Inversion, Sight, and the Twin System</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="verse"><strong>Isaiah 29:15–16</strong><br />Turning things upside down... the potter’s clay.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Isaiah 5:20–21</strong><br />Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Matthew 6:22–24</strong><br />If your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Psalm 35:19–20 / Proverbs 6:13</strong><br />They wink with their eye — covert signals of evil.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>2 Timothy 2:25–26</strong><br />Recover yourself from the snare of the devil.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>James 4:7–8</strong><br />Submit to God... purify your hearts, ye double minded.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- Part 4 -->
  <h2>Part 4: You Are Gods, Light, and the Star</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="verse"><strong>Psalm 82 / John 10:34</strong><br />Ye are gods (Elohim), children of the Most High... Jesus confirms it.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Ezekiel 28:14–15</strong><br />Lucifer, the cherub that covers, fell and covered us in flesh.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Ephesians 5:11–14</strong><br />Reprove the unfruitful works of darkness. Awake, and Christ shall give thee light.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Matthew 2:2 / Numbers 24:17</strong><br />The Star out of Jacob — prophecy of the coming King.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- Part 5 -->
  <h2>Part 5: Locusts, Birth by the Spirit, and Final Warning</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="verse"><strong>Revelation 9:1–3</strong><br />Locusts rise from the pit with power to torment.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>John 3:3–5</strong><br />Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Revelation 20:14–15</strong><br />Whosoever not written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</div>
    <div class="verse"><strong>Joshua 24:15 / John 14:6</strong><br />Choose this day whom you will serve. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Final Call</h2>
    <p>This is your wake-up call. Seek Jesus. Turn back to the Father. Ask for truth. Share the message while there's time.</p>
