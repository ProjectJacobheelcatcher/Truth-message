  <h1>The Truth Warning Message</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>This world is inverted. People are so programmed from birth that most ignore the Bible fundamentals. The devil lies and runs the kingdoms of earth. God is our designated teacher. Pray for and desire Truth (Jesus is the Truth). Ask, Seek, Knock. Daniel 2 says that God is the revealer of secrets.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Devil Runs the Kingdoms of Earth</h2>
    <p>Contemplate this scripture. The devil runs the kingdoms of earth, even though the Lord God owns it all. The tenants of earth killed God's son and the prophets. They are a rebellious house and judgment is coming to them.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 4:8-9</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.4" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain...<br>
      And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Devil is a Liar</h2>
    <p>Listen to Jesus’ words. A crime syndicate led by Lucifer runs the kingdoms of earth. God is revealing them in these last days.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>John 8:43-45</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/John.8" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Ye are of your father the devil... he is a liar, and the father of it.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Wheat and the Tares</h2>
    <p>Two races — the good seed and the tares — grow together until the harvest. Jesus says you will know them by their fruit.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Matthew 13:24-30</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Matt.13" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      Let both grow together until the harvest... gather the tares in bundles to burn them.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="section">
    <h2>Two Great Powers</h2>
    <p>Earth is between two forces — the Lord God of truth above, and the Devil of lies below. Trust in Jesus, not in men.</p>
    <div class="verse">
      <strong>Ephesians 6:10-12</strong> — <a href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/audio/mclean/kjv/Eph.6" target="_blank">Listen</a><br>
      We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers... spiritual wickedness in high places.

    <h2>More Coming Soon...</h2>
    <p>Due to the size of the full message, this is the first part. You can continue adding all remaining sections using this same format. I will help you paste it section by section until it's all complete.</p>
